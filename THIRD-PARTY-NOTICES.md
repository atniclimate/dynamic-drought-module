# Third-party notices

The Dynamic Drought Module is distributed under the licence in `LICENSE`. This file lists the third-party code that
reaches the published build, with each licence text as the package ships it. The licence texts are copied verbatim
and are not ours to reword.

## How this list was decided

The packages below include the runtime dependencies in `package.json` and their bundled dependencies.
Source maps written by `npm run build` name the package folders whose code reaches `dist/assets`.
MapLibre GL JS ships its own dependencies already bundled into its files, so its `LICENSE.txt` is the
notice that covers them.

`tests/third-party-notices.test.mjs` checks this file against `package.json`, `package-lock.json` and, when a
build exists, against those source maps.

## The ENSO flowing paths

The moving wind paths, the wave crest marks and the still form shown under reduced motion are written for this
project in `src/layers/flow/`. No code from mapbox/webgl-wind or cambecc/earth is copied.

- mapbox/webgl-wind (ISC) was a design reference only. It was read to understand the approach of moving particles
  across a wind field on the graphics card. None of its source files or shaders are in this repository.
- cambecc/earth (MIT) is named here because it is a related open source wind map. None of its code is in this
  repository.

Rule: any file or part of a file copied from a third-party project, these two included, is listed in the next
section verbatim, with its `/*! */` header, in the same commit that adds it. Without that entry the file does not
ship.

## Copied third-party source files

None.

## Other bundled assets

The fonts and map glyph files served from `fonts/` carry their own licence texts beside them, as `OFL-*.txt` files.
